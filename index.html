            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So what is Version Control? It's basically just a system that tracks changes to files and is a major time saver if you screw up as you can simply revert back to a previous version of the file or files. There are three main version control systems: Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems, and Distributed Version Control Systems. Local VCSs are within your local computer and they keep track of changes made to your files locally, usually by recording the differences between files (patch sets) and when needed it can revert a file back to any previous version by combining those patches. Centralized VCSs were the standard for a while as it made a way for people to collaborate with developers over other systems. CVCSs have one server with all the versioned files that multiple clients can access and edit. The problem with these two VCSs is that they have all the versioned files in one place, if that place were to crash or become corrupt, you lose everything. Thus, the Distributed Version Control System was developed. This system enables all clients to have a fully mirrored copy of the server's repository. This means that if the server were to crash, any client could copy their clone of the repository into the server to restore it fully. I find this topic very interesting in that we were able to come up with a way to simultaneously collaborate on projects over different computer systems while also having a basically fail proof way of all versioned files being backed up in real time.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system that is free to the public, it is designed to handle everything from the tiniest files to bigger more intensive projects with great ease and convenience. Git was developed with the goal of being simple, fast, able to support multiple branched workflows, and able to handle large projects with efficiency. Since Git's entry into the DVCSs market 12 years ago, it has become a system that is incredibly easy to learn and use while still being able to maintain its reputation of top dog in how fast, powerful, and virtually fail safe it is. I chose to write about Git because it is extremely relevant in what we are working on in class seeing as we had to use Git commands in this very assignment. Since we are using Git for our assignments, it behooved me to learn more and see what all the fuss was about.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now lets talk about GitHub, which is something we are also using in this course. GitHub is the largest 'git repository hosting service', which basically means it is a host for projects that use git. GitHub allows you to access other clients repositories as well as share your repositories with others. It's a remote repository which means you can store copies of your repositories so if your local repository were to crash, you'd be able to recover your files from GitHub. The design of GitHub is focused on collaboration workflow, specifically Topic Branch Workflow. This service streamlines using git for branch workflow as collaboration is a huge part of GitHub. Whether you want to work in a single repository with your buddies or connect to strangers all over the world to work on random projects over multiple repositories, GitHub makes it easy.   </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Cloud9</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I chose Cloud9 as my next topic simply because I feel it is a key concept within our curriculum. This is our second assignment so far with Cloud9 involved so I figured i'd learn more about it. Cloud9 is an online development environment that makes coding simple and efficient. It supports hundreds of programming languages making it a very versatile platform. It allows you to jump right into coding with Cloud9's easy to use workspaces as well as streamlining the collaboration process with its many collaborative coding attributes. Since we are in a web development class, figured it was good to point out that this is an awesome web development environment. I've personally been using the 'live preview' feature which greatly helps speed up the development process when coding. There are many other useful features such as a built-in image editor, terminal with unix commands, multiple cursors for simultaneous editing, and its compatability with other repositories. Cloud9 is by far one of my favorite development environments and I will continue to use it for the rest of my coding endeavors.</p>

            <p class="lead">Oh the infamous Bootstrap, the premiere platform for responsive design which is key regarding mobile platforms. It's an open source project that is hosted and developed on GitHub. Bootstrap deals with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is the leader in designing web pages for mobile platforms. Websites made with Bootstrap are generally very sleek yet attention grabbing, making it a widely popular framework. Bootstrap has drawn a big audience with its responsive design which is supported across all platforms, especially since nowadays mobile devices are more commonly used to browse the web than computers. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Bootstrap and what other frameworks may rise to the top.  </p>
